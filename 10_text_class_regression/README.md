# Guidelines

This chapter shows how we can start develop solutions for NLP problems.
All chapter works with IMBD dataset. The objective is build a model
to predict if a movie description has a positive ou negative sentimental.
This is a typical classification problem.

The book gives us insights to handle with NLP problems but not explains the models.
So, if you are not familarized with any model, study first the model and go back to the book.
There are many books and blogs available from where you can get this knowledge. The intention of this book is provide guidelines to build our approach. Most the work needs to be done by who is interested in these subjects.

It starts very simple, as always is recommended. The chapter is organized in folders:
- **imbd_sentiment**: linear regression, naive bayes, n-grams, sentence to vector, svd, tf-idf
- **imbd_lstm**: Long Short Term Memory implementation. But it is possible to modify it to GRU, and use other pre-trained models besides of FastText (read book for more details)
- **imbd_transformers**: The new NLP era uses Transformers. Please, study first in other references what is a Transformer. After that go back to the book to understand the code implementation.


If you want to acquire knowledge about Deep Learning for NLP one of books that I can recommend 
to you is:

Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing: Creating Neural Network with Python

Authors: Palash, Goyal, Sumit Pandley, Karan Jain.

You can find more about it in:

For Transform models I recommend to read this blog to understand the theorical part:
