Like the second movie, Terminator 2: Judgment Day, this one also has little value. Some may revere it culturally but they are clearly mistaken. It is a violent movie which showcases murder and White masculinity. I would never recommend this piece of trash to anyone. There's much more than this short paragraph to describe this film, however. This science fiction film, directed by James Cameron, has become a classic despite what I have previously stated. The horrid violence of this film is not the worst part, but rather than even the time travel to the past is not very interesting either. Other movies have much better forms of time travel than this film. You could say that film is, like the New York Times said when it was first released, "B-movie with flair," or like the Pittsburgh Press and say it has "artsy ugliness." Both of those views have validity. I would add that this film pushed Arnold Schwarzenegger further to stardom and is one of the films is is most known for, not surprisingly. Otherwise, I don't think it is worth reviewing this film any further as I'd rather review more worthwhile films, with this film definitely deserving a rating of 1 out of 10, one of the lowest ratings I have ever given a movie.
