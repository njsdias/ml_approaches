We can see at the end that this is unfinished business and there must be sequels. That is what I like the most. Without it this movie would not make much sense. Also good topic: time travel. I am amazed by technology and stunts display considering how old this movie is. Better than most today's. The only bit bad thing is unexplained and unreasonable appearance of two guys who chase girl or each other. Although explained somewhat it is still somehow too quick, unexplained, unnatural. Unlike most movies, this one is not better than its later sequels.
