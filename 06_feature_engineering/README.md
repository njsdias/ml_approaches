# Feature Engineering

Feature engineering is not just about creating new features from data but also includes
different types of normalization and transformations.

- If we have useful features, the model will perform better

- With feature engeering we can avoid large, complicated models

- It is better done when we have some knowledge about the domain of the problem and depends a lot on the data concern.
